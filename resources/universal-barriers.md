## Awareness

Users need to be made aware that the service exists, and that they are eligible to use it. They also need to be aware of the service through a range of channels.

### Examples of excluded groups

Refugees and asylum seekers can be unaware of their entitlements to health services in the UK

### How can this affect anyone?

Anyone new to the UK who may not be aware of their entitlements. Anyone given misinformation about eligibility

## Time

Users need to be able access at times that suit their life, and options need to be available to all users to access the service outside of standard hours.

### Examples of excluded groups

Migrant workers often have long working hours or are on zero hour contracts without flexibility to attend appointments during the day

### How can this affect anyone?

Anyone who is unable to take time off work during the day. Anyone with an insecure or unsupportive workplace

## Finance

Users need to be able to afford our services in proportion to the service being offered. It's also good to consider whether users need to pay for evidence, travel or take time off work to complete the service.

### Examples of excluded groups

Some users will not have belief in their ability to interact with the service, or to complete tasks, or deal with uncertainty.

### Examples of excluded groups
