# Vision for the team

UKHSA will have a mature inclusive design function that enables human-centred design, product, technical, operations, clinical and service owners to have a clear understanding of their role in designing and delivering inclusive and accessible services.
We will expand our ability to help and guide teams across different channels and touchpoints, including;

- Digital
- Physical (for example test kits and the built environment)
- Operations (for example call centres and staff training)
- Instructions and communications (for example, instructions, signage and videos)
- Outsourced touchpoints (for example pharmacies, care homes and universities)

Starting with the inclusive design team, and later through an inclusive design community of practice, we will work across UKHSA (and partner organisations like NHS digital) to create an open culture of sharing best practice and identifying inclusive design champions.

We'll contribute and share what we learn openly across government and NHS, by working in the open, blogging, sharing our tools and contributing to service manuals. This will help to share what UKHSA has learnt, but also invite critique from the inclusive design and accessibility community across government and NHS. We'll work with the [universal barriers framework](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/03/26/understanding-all-the-barriers-service-users-might-face/) to improve and adopt guidelines that help us design for everyone equally. 

In future, UKHSA will have the capability to design services in a way that meets inclusive and accessible best practices, standards and laws by default. More importantly it will consistently do user-research and co-design with people, communities and organisations that are impacted by our services, so we that can reduce historical health inequalities and improve trust in government and health services.

These practices will also be baked into our governance processes, for example via the Design Authority and external Service Standard assessments, supported by the inclusive design team's accountability framework.

We will become a centre of excellence, showing the rest of the organisation what good inclusive design looks like. We’ll have a multi-disciplinary team including;

- Service design
-	Content design
-	User research
-	Accessibility specialists 
-	Product and delivery roles

We will hire permanent accessibility specialists and co-design specialists lead by relevant heads of profession and develop strong relationships with external suppliers who can audit our work.

We will develop a definition for inclusive design that builds on [point 5 of the service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service) and that helps teams to understand how to design services that reduce health inequalities, by considering; 
- people’s legally protected characteristics
- barriers that prevent people for accessing health care services, for example; awareness, comprehension, emotional state, trust, evidence, enthusiasm, time, finance, access, interface/interaction capability and self confidence
- people  who are greater risk from current and future health threats. 
- [the core 20 plus 5 approach](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/core20plus5/)
