# How is the Inclusive Design team structured?

Weâ€™re a multi-disciplinary team of [user-centred designers](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#user-centred-design-job-family) and [product and delivery](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#product-and-delivery-job-family) people.

We work across UKHSA with human-centred design teams (that are focused on service design and delivery) and health equity policy teams to improve the inclusivity and accessibility of customer journeys.

We work across organisations including NHS Digital, NHS.UK and GOV.UK.

(Note, we're a little smaller than this at the moment, but I'll describe how we were setup at our highest point.)
