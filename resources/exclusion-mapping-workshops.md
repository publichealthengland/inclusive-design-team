## What are Exclusion Mapping Workshops?

Exclusion mapping workshops are designed to allow service teams to review their existing user journeys from the perspective of excluded groups to identify pain points and recommendations for improvement on how to make their services more inclusive.

Exclusion mapping workshops have five main interactions with service teams. They are as follows:

1. **Kick off** - Initial discussions with the team that require assistance to understand their service and scope of the work.
2. **Workshop 1** - Workshop to identify the key inclusive design pain points in their service.
3. **Workshop 2** - Workshop to come up with key recommendations on how to make their service more inclusive.
4. **Workshop 3** - Workshop to prioritise recommendations so they are ready to go on the service team’s backlog.
5. **Offboarding** - Final discussions with the team to summarise the workshops and why it’s important to implement the suggested changes.

## 1. Kick off, and Prep for workshop 1: Aligning research to the 11 universal barriers framework

**Purpose**: to show how existing user research aligns to the 11 barriers framework.

**Desired outcome**: to have a condensed, single view of where there are gaps and barriers in the service.

1. The service designers set up a kick off meeting with the service team to determine their objectives and our overall scope for the workshops.
2. The service designers request existing user research on the service they’re examining from the service teams, even if it isn’t about excluded groups specifically.
3. Then, the service designers then review the research and align it to the 11 universal barriers framework to determine where there are gaps, and also to familiarise themselves with the service they’re going to workshop.

### What is the Universal Barriers Framework?

This framework outlines 11 different categories of exclusion that can happen throughout your service.

Our hypothesis is that by using barriers as a frame to assess our services, we can design services that are more inclusive for everyone.

### The 11 barriers

1. Awareness
2. Time
3. Finance
4. Access
5. Interace / interaction skills
6. Self confidence
7. Comprehension
8. Emotional State
9. Trust
10. Evidence
11. Enthusiasm
