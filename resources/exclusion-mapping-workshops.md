## What are Exclusion Mapping Workshops?

Exclusion mapping workshops are designed to allow service teams to review their existing user journeys from the perspective of excluded groups to identify pain points and recommendations for improvement on how to make their services more inclusive.

Exclusion mapping workshops have five main interactions with service teams. They are as follows:

1. **Kick off** - Initial discussions with the team that require assistance to understand their service and scope of the work.
2. **Workshop 1** - Workshop to identify the key inclusive design pain points in their service.
3. **Workshop 2** - Workshop to come up with key recommendations on how to make their service more inclusive.
4. **Workshop 3** - Workshop to prioritise recommendations so they are ready to go on the service team’s backlog.
5. **Offboarding** - Final discussions with the team to summarise the workshops and why it’s important to implement the suggested changes.
